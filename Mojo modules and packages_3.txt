## Argument passing control and memory ownership
In both Python and Mojo, much of the language revolves around function calls: 
a lot of the (apparently) built-in behaviors are implemented in the standard library with “dunder” (double-underscore) methods. 
Inside these magic functions is where a lot of memory ownership is determined through argument passing

1. All values passed into a Python def function use reference semantics. 
This means the function can modify mutable objects passed into it and those changes are visible outside the function. 
However, the behavior is sometimes surprising for the uninitiated, 
because you can change the object that an argument points to and that change is not visible outside the function

2. All values passed into a Mojo def function use value semantics by default. C
ompared to Python, this is an important difference: 
A Mojo def function receives a copy of all arguments—it can modify arguments inside the function, 
but the changes are not visible outside the function.

3. All values passed into a Mojo fn function are immutable references by default. 
This means the function can read the original object (it is not a copy), but it cannot modify the object at all

This convention for immutable argument passing in a Mojo fn is called “borrowing.” 
In the following sections, we’ll explain how you can change the argument passing behavior in Mojo, for both def and fn functions.
